# MissingDataCalculator

This script is a work in progress. Improvements to be made soon are: 
  Direct read-in of NEXUS files
  Accomodate multistate codings
  Ability to choose new taxa after completing calculations without needing to relaunch script.
  Select entire matrix for calculation without needing to name taxa individually.
